## The Skills

### Discipline Layer — *Process before code*

| Skill | Invoke | What it does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **ORACLE** | `/oracle` | Classify complexity, select skill chain, assign model tier before ANY task |
| **FORGE** | `/forge` | Red-Green-Refactor with AI — write the test before the code, always |
| **HUNTER** | `/hunter` | Evidence before hypothesis, bisect to root cause, store pattern |
| **SENTINEL** | `/sentinel` | Confidence gate before completion — HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW score |
| **ARCHITECT** | `/architect` | Design-before-code: 2-3 approaches, trade-offs, spec document |
| **BLUEPRINT** | `/blueprint` | SPARC-structured implementation plans for complex tasks |

### Domain Layer — *Expertise on demand*

| Skill | Invoke | Domain | Lazy-loaded patterns |
|-------|--------|--------|---------------------|
| **GRADIENT** | `/gradient` | ML pipelines → MLOps | data-pipeline, model-training, model-serving, mlops |
| **NEXUS** | `/nexus` | RAG · agents · prompts · eval | rag-architecture, agent-patterns, prompt-engineering, llm-evaluation |
| **IRONCORE** | `/ironcore` | ISRs · RTOS · state machines · hardware | state-machines, isr-safety, rtos-tasks, hardware-abstraction |
| **PRISM** | `/prism` | UI · accessibility · Core Web Vitals · bundle | 67 UI styles, 25 chart types, WCAG 2.1 AA, CWV targets |

### Intelligence Layer — *Memory that compounds*

| Skill | Invoke | What it does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **CHRONICLE** | `/chronicle` | Build a searchable ReasoningBank of solved patterns |
| **HORIZON** | `/horizon` | Track token budget, compress context, handoff to fresh session |
| **PATHFINDER** | `/pathfinder` | Map unfamiliar codebases in 5 phases before starting work |

### Coordination Layer — *Scale to parallel execution*

| Skill | Invoke | What it does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **VECTOR** | `/vector` | Route by complexity: Tier 0 (no LLM) → Tier 3 (Opus). Cuts costs 50-65% |
| **LEGION** | `/legion` | Parallel agent topologies: parallel, pipeline, hierarchical, mesh |
| **COMMANDER** | `/commander` | Dispatch subagents with isolated worktrees and context budgets |
| **PHANTOM** | `/phantom` | Subagent roles: implementer, reviewer, debugger, researcher |
| **TRIBUNAL** | `/tribunal` | Domain-aware code review: ML / AI / Embedded / Frontend / Security |
| **ASCEND** | *(auto-loads)* | The meta-skill governing all others — loads at every session start |

### Execution Layer — *Safe, verified delivery*

| Skill | Invoke | What it does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **VAULT** | `/vault` | Isolated git worktrees — safe workspace before any implementation begins |
| **SEAL** | `/seal` | Structured branch completion: verify tests → merge / PR / keep / discard |
| **EXODUS** | `/exodus` | Execute plans in a completely fresh isolated session — zero context pollution |
| **ARBITER** | `/arbiter` | Receive code review with technical rigor — verify before implementing, push back when wrong |
| **SCULPTOR** | `/sculptor` | TDD applied to skill creation — no skill ships without a failing test first |

## How It Works

Skills are Markdown files (`SKILL.md`) that Claude Code loads on demand. Only relevant skills incur token cost.

```
skills/
  oracle/        SKILL.md  ← ~700 tokens, loads when task starts
  gradient/      SKILL.md  ← lean index, ~700 tokens
                 patterns/
                   data-pipeline.md    ← loads only when you're working on pipelines
                   model-training.md   ← loads only when training
                   model-serving.md    ← loads only when working on serving
                   mlops.md            ← loads only for MLOps work
```

## The Chain System

ORACLE classifies every task and selects the right chain automatically:

```
BUG       →  CHRONICLE → HUNTER → FORGE → SENTINEL → CHRONICLE (store)
FEATURE   →  ORACLE → [domain] → ARCHITECT → BLUEPRINT → VAULT → PHANTOM → SENTINEL → TRIBUNAL → SEAL
REFACTOR  →  FORGE (baseline) → BLUEPRINT → VAULT → EXODUS → SENTINEL → SEAL
ARCHITECT →  ARCHITECT → BLUEPRINT (SPARC) → TRIBUNAL → CHRONICLE
REVIEW    →  TRIBUNAL (request) → ARBITER (receive) → SENTINEL
NEW SKILL →  SCULPTOR (TDD for skills)
```

---

## Model Tier Routing (VECTOR)

```
Complexity 1-3  →  Tier 0  (no LLM)   mechanical: rename, sort, format
Complexity 1-3  →  Tier 1  (Haiku)    simple lookups, single-file edits
Complexity 4-6  →  Tier 2  (Sonnet)   standard development — the default
Complexity 7-9  →  Tier 2→3 (Sonnet → Opus)  escalate if stuck
Complexity 10   →  Tier 3  (Opus)     security-critical, architecture decisions
```
Systematic tier routing cuts API costs **50-65%** vs treating everything as Tier 3.

## The Auto-Memory System

Skills work with Claude Code's persistent memory at `~/.claude/projects/<hash>/memory/`.

Four memory types:

```
user      — who you are, expertise, working preferences
feedback  — corrections + validated approaches (Why + How to apply)
project   — active initiatives, architecture decisions, constraints
reference — where to find external information
```

Example index (`MEMORY.md`):
```markdown
- [User Profile](user_profile.md) — Python engineer, new to React; frame frontend in Python terms
- [CHRONICLE: Stripe Webhooks](pattern_backend_stripe.md) — return 200 immediately, process async
- [FORGE: No DB Mocks](feedback_db_tests.md) — use real DB; mocks caused prod incident
- [Project: Auth Rewrite](project_auth.md) — compliance-driven; deadline fixed by legal
```

Built on [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) by Jesse Vincent. Extended with 10 new skills, specific engineering improvements directed by GadaaLabs, and an override infrastructure that makes your skills survive plugin updates automatically.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GadaaLabs/claude-code-on-steroids/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Requires:** [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) · Node.js 18+

## The Token Burn Problem — Why This Exists

The biggest pain point in Claude Code is not missing workflows. It is token burn.

**obra/superpowers gives you 14 structured workflows. It gives you zero memory, zero context management, and zero cost routing.** Every session restart costs 5,000–15,000 tokens to re-establish context. Every repeated debugging problem costs 8,000–15,000 tokens to re-investigate from scratch. Every mechanical task routes through the LLM when it should hit a shell tool.

This is what was engineered closed:

| Scenario | obra/superpowers | Claude Code on Steroids | Savings |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------|---------|
| Debug: 2nd encounter of same problem | 8,000–15,000 tok (full re-investigation) | ~50 tok (chronicle cache hit) | **up to 99%** |
| Context window limit hit | 5,000–15,000 tok (crash + restart) | 0 tok (horizon compresses) | **100%** |
| Mechanical task (rename, format, import) | 500–2,000 tok (LLM call) | 0 tok (vector Tier 0 → shell) | **100%** |
| New codebase exploration | 30,000–60,000 tok (random reads) | 8,000–12,000 tok (pathfinder 5-phase) | **60–80%** |
| Session bootstrap | 1,023 tok | 1,484 tok | –461 tok overhead |
| Debug: 1st encounter | 1,955 tok | 4,246 tok | –2,291 tok investment |

The first two scenarios cost more upfront. Every subsequent encounter pays the investment back. By day 2 of any engineering sprint, the cumulative burn has already crossed over in your favor.

## The Skills — All 24

### Evolved from obra originals (12 skills)

| Skill | obra original | What was improved |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **forge** | test-driven-development | + Mandatory API pre-verification step before writing any test. Prevents phantom-API test failures. |
| **blueprint** | writing-plans | + Phase 0 Documentation Discovery — verifies every API in the spec exists before a plan is written |
| **ascend** | using-superpowers | + 6 workflow chains, 13-entry domain trigger table, oracle-first intake rule |
| **commander** | dispatching-parallel-agents | + COMMANDER vs PHANTOM decision table — eliminates the most common dispatch mistake |
| **hunter** | systematic-debugging | + Root-cause bisect protocol, defense-in-depth patterns |
| **sentinel** | verification-before-completion | + Confidence scoring gate (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW) with evidence requirements |
| **architect** | brainstorming | + Spec document reviewer, visual companion |
| **arbiter** | receiving-code-review | + Technical verification protocol before implementing any suggestion |
| **tribunal** | requesting-code-review | + Domain-aware criteria: ML / AI / Embedded / Frontend / Security |
| **vault** | using-git-worktrees | + Worktree lifecycle management, safety verification |
| **seal** | finishing-a-development-branch | + Four structured completion options with verification |
| **sculptor** | writing-skills | + TDD applied to skill creation — Iron Law for process documentation |

### Brand new — not in obra (10 skills)

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **oracle** | Classifies task complexity, selects skill chain, assigns model tier. Run before every non-trivial task. |
| **chronicle** | Self-learning memory. Stores solved patterns in a ReasoningBank. 3-layer token-efficient retrieval before each task. |
| **pathfinder** | 5-phase codebase exploration protocol. Maps entry points, architecture, and traps before writing code. |
| **vector** | Model cost routing. Tier 0 ($0, no LLM) for mechanical tasks. Tier 3 (Opus) only when complexity demands it. |
| **horizon** | Context window budget management. Tracks token usage, compresses when needed, hands off cleanly. |
| **legion** | Multi-agent swarm coordination. Hierarchical / mesh / ring / star topologies with ready-to-use prompt templates. |
| **gradient** | ML domain expertise: data pipelines, model training, serving infrastructure, MLOps, drift detection. |
| **nexus** | AI engineering: RAG architectures, agent patterns, prompt engineering, LLM evaluation frameworks. |
| **ironcore** | Embedded systems: ISRs, RTOS task design, state machines, hardware abstraction, timing analysis. |
| **prism** | UI/UX engineering: 67 design styles, 25 chart types, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility, Core Web Vitals targets. |

### Restructured from obra (2 → 3 skills)

obra's `executing-plans` and `subagent-driven-development` were split into:

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **phantom** | In-session parallel plan execution with 2-stage review (spec compliance → code quality) |
| **exodus** | Plan execution in a completely fresh isolated session — zero context pollution |

---

## The Override Infrastructure

Both obra and the official plugin distribution share the same gap: plugin updates overwrite any customizations.

Our installer adds `apply.sh` + a `SessionStart` hook to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```
Session opens
  → SessionStart hook fires
  → apply.sh reads installed plugin path from installed_plugins.json
  → Copies 9 pinned skill files over the plugin files
  → Session begins with your locked versions in place
```

**Plugin updates to any future version?** Next session, your pinned versions win automatically. Zero maintenance.

Skills pinned: `ascend` `blueprint` `chronicle` `commander` `forge` `legion` `pathfinder` `phantom` `vector`

## The 6 Workflow Chains (in ascend)

```
DEBUG     →  chronicle → hunter → forge → sentinel → oracle → chronicle(store)

FEATURE   →  oracle → chronicle → [domain] → architect → blueprint
             → horizon → vector + legion → phantom → sentinel → tribunal
             → oracle → chronicle(store)

ARCH      →  oracle → chronicle → architect → blueprint → tribunal
             → oracle → chronicle(store)

REFACTOR  →  oracle → forge → blueprint → horizon → sentinel
             → oracle → chronicle(store)

ML/AI/EE/UI → oracle → [gradient|nexus|ironcore|prism]
              → feature-chain or debug-chain

LONG SESSION → horizon → continue or fresh handoff
```

---

## Quick Start After Install

```bash
cd your-project && claude

/oracle        # Start every non-trivial task here
/gradient      # ML work
/nexus         # RAG / agent work
/hunter        # Hard debugging
/pathfinder    # Unfamiliar codebase
/forge         # Writing tests — TDD first, always
```
